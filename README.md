# ThreeJS Sketchfab Code Example

This is a minimal code example for how to load 3D models as glTF from the Sketchfab API into a ThreeJS scene. 

It shows how to authenticate & fetch the model, and how to correctly load a glTF model inside a zip file into ThreeJS.

### Live example

This repo does not contain any live Sketchfab credentials. You can see a version of this in my [WebGL outlines tutorial](https://github.com/OmarShehata/webgl-outlines#live-demo). First, click "Login with Sketchfab", then paste in any Sketchfab URL.
